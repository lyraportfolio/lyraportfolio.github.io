nstall "mkcert":

Install "mkcert" on your system. You can find installation instructions for your specific platform on the "mkcert" GitHub repository: https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert
Generate Self-Signed Certificates:

Use "mkcert" to generate self-signed SSL/TLS certificates for your local domain. For example:

shell
Copy code
mkcert -install
mkcert localhost
This will create two files: localhost.pem (certificate) and localhost-key.pem (private key).

Set Up a Local HTTPS Server:

You can use a local server that supports HTTPS to serve your content. Here's an example using Node.js and the "http-server" package:

Install the "http-server" package globally if you haven't already:

shell
Copy code
npm install -g http-server
Start the HTTPS server with the generated certificates:



cmd as admin

navigate to github directory 

http-server -S -C localhost.pem -K localhost-key.pem
