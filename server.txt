Python SimpleHTTPServer (Quick and Less Secure):

Alternatively, if you want a quick solution, you can use Python's SimpleHTTPServer with HTTPS. Note that this method uses a self-signed certificate and is less secure than the Node.js and Express approach.

Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.

Run the following command to start a simple HTTP server with HTTPS support:

bash
Copy code
python -m http.server 8000 --bind localhost --directory C:\Users\Alex\Documents\GitHub\lyrarobinson.github.io
Replace 'path/to/your/project' with the actual path to your project directory.

Access your webpage at https://localhost:8000.
