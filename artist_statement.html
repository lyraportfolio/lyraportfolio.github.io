        I am a 21 year old new media artist from Manchester, currently studying at Camberwell College of Arts. <br> 
        My work exploits and manipulates experimental physical computing, deep learning, and machine vision processes <br>
        to interrogate complex relationships within human-machine ecologies.

	<p>
		Inspired by the transformative potential of cyber-feminism and queerness, I imagine alternative, speculative <br>
		futures that challenge our integration 
        within hyper-digitised systems, and seek to <br>
		propose new modalities of engagement and co-existence at the intersection 
        of technology and identity.
