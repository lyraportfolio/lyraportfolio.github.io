    <p>Lyra (b.2002) is a <strong>trans</strong>disciplinary new media artist, whose work spans performance, installation, and video. She works primarily with ones and zeroes; manipulating experimental machine vision and deep learning processes</p>
	<p>Informed by Critical Posthumanism and Cyborg theory, her work interrogates human-machine ecologies and Biotechnological Assemblage, aiming to uncover how technologies, both optic and communicative, mediate 21st century experience and circumscribe our understanding of the body. </p>
	<p>Her primary mode of inquiry is through moving image, using eclectic and unconventional media to position diagnostic practice as a liberating act of Play. </p>  
    <p>She has exhibited in London, Athens, and Amsterdam. </p>
