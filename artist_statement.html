        I am a 21 year old new media artist from Manchester, currently studying at Camberwell College of Arts. 
        My work exploits and manipulates experimental physical computing, deep learning, and machine vision processes 
        to interrogate complex relationships within human-machine ecologies.

        Inspired by the transformative potential of cyber-feminism and queerness, I imagine alternative, speculative
        futures that challenge our integration 
        within hyper-digitised systems, and seek to 
        propose new modalities of engagement and co-existence at the intersection 
        of technology and identity.
